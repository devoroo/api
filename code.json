Learn the strengths and weaknesses of different terrains, utilize cover effectively, and adapt your tactics based on the environment. Mountains offer natural chokepoints, forests provide concealment, and open plains demand strategic use of speed and cover.",
            "part2": "Weather the Storms: Be prepared for the harsh Siberian elements. Blizzards can reduce visibility and slow your train, while scorching heat can damage your engine and dehydrate your crew. Plan your travel accordingly, stock up on resources, and adapt your strategies to overcome environmental challenges.
Use Your Surroundings: The environment is not just a backdrop; it's a tool. Destroy enemy barricades with your train's cannon, lure enemies into environmental hazards, and utilize terrain features to gain an advantage in combat. Be creative and think outside the box to use the environment to your advantage."
